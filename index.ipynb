    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project creates a model that forecasts the number of deaths by Covid-19 given the historical data.  The Covid-19 pandemic was detrimental in the number of people who perished from this disease.  The idea behind this project is that if we can create a predictive model that will forecast the amount of harm, then public health officials can be better informed, advised, and empowered to mitigate future deaths.  Specifically, this project focuses on a continent-wide evaluation, looking at Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project goes through a model iteration process, starting with a naive time series model, and iterating through ARIMA, multivariate ARIMA, Linear Regression, Facebook's Prophet, and multivariate prophet models.  The project finalizes on the multivariate prophet model as the final model based on the evaluation metric, root mean squared error, and evaluates this model on the holdout test set.  Lastly, the project offers a few recommendations to the proposed business and next steps for future projects.\n",

    "The Covid-19 pandemic needs little introduction as it left no corner of our world untouched.  It devastated lives, and economies -- day-to-day life was dramatically altered for about 2-3 years.  During the pandemic, the World Health Organization, along with many other public health entities, concerned themselves with not only reacting to this public health crisis but also to recording and analyzing the data from the outbreak. This data accumulation was not only a way to evaluate the devastation and how different countries handled the situation, but also to allowed them to provide better recommendations and make impactful decisions concerning public health.

    "The specific business for this project is one akin to the World Health Organization (WHO) that 'treats data as a public good'([WHO Principles](https://data.who.int/about/data/who-data-principles), and also wants to leverage this data to make recommendations to public health officials.  When the pandemic arose, the WHO aided in the response including \"facilitating research, develping guidance, coordinating vaccine development and distribution, and monitoring daily case numbers and trends around the world\" ([WHO_COVID-19](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)). Another company, Our World in Data, has extensive documentation of the Covid-19 pandemic ([Our World in Data/coronavirus](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for this project is to create a model that will forecast how much worse the pandemic will be in order to advise public health officials and policy makers on how to best handle the situation such that damages are minimized. We will use the number of deaths as the target to forecast and evaluate how harmful the outbreak is (or will be for predictions)."

    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we look at the complete data and find that there are quite a few redundancies in the accumulated data.  With the idea of modeling in mind, many of the columns are dropped.  For example, the data includes `total_cases`, `new_cases`, `new_cases_smoothed`, `new_cases_per_million`, and `new_cases_smoothed_per_million`.  For modeling, specifically for time series modeling, we are interested in the daily reports, and thus keep `new_cases_smoothed` because (a) smoothed data is better for seeing trends and (b) we want to work with the real data of the number of new cases that occurred each day.  This logic is applied to many of the variables in the original data set.  See below for a list of the variables kept and their definitions.  See also the [GitHub page](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) for a full list of all the variables and their descriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a visual of the countries in which the data is coming from is produced. The idea behind this is to try and see the best way to splice the data -- is it best by individual country, continent or by something else?  After looking at this map, it is decided to break up the data by continent and focus on Asia.  *(The original idea was to create models for each continent, but this project only had the bandwidth to look at one.  Future work would be to expand this to the other continents and compare.)* \n",
    "\n",
    "The project then transitions into a data cleaning phase in order to deal with the missing values in the Asia subset before looking at other 'data exploration' visuals.  The reasoning behind this is we want to explore the dataset that will be used in modeling; however this needs to be created by aggregating the Asia subset such that there is only one entry per day.  The missing values must be dealt with prior to aggregating.  See below for further details that occur during the Data Cleaning phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "> One note concerning the data cleaning phase.  A limitation of this project in specific is not only the amount of missing data in the raw data source, but also the question behind the validity of the data itself.  While the WHO is a very reputable source and is to be trusted, it is widely known that countries in Asia, namely China and India, were suspected of purposefully mis-reporting deaths due to Covid-19.  It is important to keep in mind that the model can only ever be as good as the data used.  (see [China is 'heavily underreporting' ...](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/china-heavily-underreporting-number-covid-19-deaths/story?id=96389383), [China deletes Covid-19 death data](https://www.ft.com/content/a634d844-5298-441b-b2e8-0eabe0b3c1d7), [WHO says China revised...](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/who-says-china-revised-coronavirus-infection-data-to-leave-no-case-undocumented.html), [COVID mortality in India](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9836201/), and [WHO says millions of Covid deaths...](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-says-millions-of-covid-deaths-went-unreported-in-india-centre-strongly-objects-methodology-key-points/articleshow/91349479.cms) for further reading).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the project goes over some visuals for the aggregated Asia subset data that will be used for modeling, including showing the target variable that will be used for the strictly time series models (as well as all the models), the nubmer of new deaths per day."

In part, this is because the pandemic had more or less ended by this time (mid 2023), which means the actual values for our data lie very close to zero, whereas our model is predicting the deaths to increase once again (similar to the actuals of July in 2020).  \n",

    "# Conclusion + Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project completes what it set out to do. We have created a predictive time series model that will forecast the number of deaths that will occur in the near future.  Having such a model, especially one that takes into consideration factors such as the stringency index which directly relates to the public health policies currently put in place, can be very useful to public health officials.  With this information they can work on when to ramp up or ease off public health ordinances such as mask mandates and social distancing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations for the business are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utilize the model to advise public health officials.**  Once we have forecasting the amount of harm predicted, we can then advise public health officials on what actions to take concerning public health measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders (either to make more strict or lessen).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Utilize the model to aid in resource planning.**  From our forecasts of when spikes will occur, we can make recommendations  to vendors and hospitals concerning resource planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Investigate why deaths tend to be reported higher on Fridays.** From our final model, we can see a weekly trend where reported number of deaths is generally higher on Fridays by about 4 people, and lower earlier in the week by about 3 people. While a slight trend, it would be interesting to investigate why this is;  if it is anything in the hospitals systems or public health trends that can be addressed in such a way that number of deaths lessens.\n",

    "###  Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always more to do and try!  Below are some ideas for expanding on this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continue to make data more accurate and complete\n",
    "    - The missing, purposefully mis-reported, and unusable data all made our model less accurate than it could have been.  Looking for ways in the future to gain accurate, consistent data, as well as ways to utilize the 'constants' would be beneficial in future model endeavors. \n",
    "- Data by continent\n",
    "    - compare predictive models by continent\n",
    "    - compare how well each continent handled the pandemic\n",
    "- Data by country\n",
    "    - create regressive model that can predict number of deaths based on location (and other variables that were in dataset) *Not Time Series*\n",
    "    - Time series by country and then create a user interface to choose country and date to forecast and then predicts number of deaths"
